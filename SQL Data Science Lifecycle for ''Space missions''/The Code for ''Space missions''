SELECT name, sql FROM sqlite_master WHERE type='table' ;


-- 1. Data cleaning:

-- Replace missing values in the payload_weight_kg column with 0
UPDATE space_missions
SET payload_weight_kg = 0
WHERE payload_weight_kg IS NULL;

-- Remove outliers from the payload_weight_kg column
DELETE FROM space_missions
WHERE payload_weight_kg > (
  SELECT AVG(payload_weight_kg) + 3*STDDEV(payload_weight_kg)
  FROM space_missions
);

-- Convert the launch_date column to a date data type
ALTER TABLE space_missions
CHANGE launch_date launch_date DATE;


-- 2. Data exploration:

-- Show the distribution of launches by year
SELECT YEAR(launch_date) AS year, COUNT(*) AS num_launches
FROM space_missions
GROUP BY year
ORDER BY year;

-- Compare success rate by country
SELECT country, AVG(success) AS success_rate
FROM space_missions
GROUP BY country
ORDER BY success_rate DESC;

-- Find the average payload weight by rocket type
SELECT rocket_type, AVG(payload_weight_kg) AS avg_payload_weight
FROM space_missions
GROUP BY rocket_type;


-- 3. Data analysis:

-- Find the top 5 countries by number of launches
SELECT country, COUNT(*) AS num_launches
FROM space_missions
GROUP BY country
ORDER BY num_launches DESC
LIMIT 5;

-- Calculate the average payload weight by rocket type
SELECT rocket_type, AVG(payload_weight_kg) AS avg_payload_weight
FROM space_missions
GROUP BY rocket_type;

-- Find the top 5 most successful rocket types
SELECT rocket_type, COUNT(*) AS num_launches, AVG(success) AS success_rate
FROM space_missions
GROUP BY rocket_type
HAVING AVG(success) = 1
ORDER BY num_launches DESC
LIMIT 5;




-- 4. Data presentation:
-- Use a line chart to show the distribution of launches by year.

-- Use a bar chart to compare the success rate of launches by country.

-- Use a pie chart to show the average payload weight by rocket type.

-- Use text and tables to present the top 5 countries by number of launches,
-- the average payload weight by rocket type, and the top 5 most successful rocket types.

-- Provide examples of how your findings can be applied in the real world.

-- Offer recommendations for future research or action based on your analysis..
