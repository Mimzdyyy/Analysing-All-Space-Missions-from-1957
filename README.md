Who does not love Space? This DataSet was scraped from https://nextspaceflight.com/launches/past/?page=1 and includes all the space missions since the beginning of Space Race (1957)


The dataset you linked to is a list of all space missions that have been conducted since 1957. It includes information about each mission, such as the name of the mission, the launch date, the launch vehicle, and the agency responsible for the mission. The dataset also includes details about the payload of each mission, including the type of spacecraft and the objectives of the mission.

The dataset is hosted on Kaggle, a platform for data science and machine learning. It was created by a user named "agirlcoding," who compiled the data from various sources. The dataset has been updated several times since it was first published, with the most recent update occurring in September 2021.

This dataset could be useful for anyone interested in the history of space exploration or in analyzing trends in space missions over time.
